My personal website!
Built with Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. Deployed using Vercel. 
This was my first time using Tailwind, it made things a whole lot easier!
This project gave me some practice working with react hooks (useEffect in particular) to create a "typewriter" component for the main text.
